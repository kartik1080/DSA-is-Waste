Why Some Think DSA Feels Like a Waste

Not directly used in jobs

Most real-world software development doesn’t ask you to implement linked lists, red-black trees, or Dijkstra’s from scratch. Frameworks, databases, and libraries already provide optimized versions.

So learners ask: “Why am I grinding problems that I’ll never code at work?”

Too much theory vs. practice

Many DSA problems are contrived puzzles (like LeetCode “hard” questions) that don’t mirror real business logic.

It can feel like solving brain teasers instead of building useful systems.

Time sink

Mastering DSA takes hundreds of hours. If someone just wants to build apps, websites, or automation scripts, that time might feel better spent learning frameworks, APIs, or deployment.

Job market perception

In some regions, only “big tech” interviews rely heavily on DSA. If you’re targeting startups, web dev, or DevOps roles, companies rarely ask advanced DSA. So it feels irrelevant.

Why It’s Not Actually a Waste

Foundation for problem-solving

Even if you don’t code trees daily, understanding them improves how you think about time/space trade-offs.

Example: Choosing between a list vs. a set in Python can mean 100× faster lookups — that’s pure DSA.

Interviews & competitive edge

Many top tech companies still filter candidates with DSA-heavy rounds. It’s less about the exact code, more about showing structured thinking.

Hidden in real-world tools

Databases use B-trees, OS schedulers use queues, compilers use graphs. You may not re-implement them, but knowing how they work helps you optimize/debug.
